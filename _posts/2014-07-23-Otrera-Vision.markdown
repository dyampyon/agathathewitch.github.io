Two months ago I had an idea for a table top RPG. I started putting it together using spreadsheets and word processors since the combat and character leveling engines were fairly deep. After I had created most of my content, I got frustrated at how difficult it was to properly test and balance everything for the finished game.

I decided to use my Python knowledge to try to make some simple tools to automate testing and balancing. This was about two weeks ago. I coded up a character builder and some modules to deal with content, classes, and levels. It seemed like a cool utility, so I decided to generalize it and make a separate product.

This is how Otrera was born.

Since the creation of the separate engine, my ambition for what Otrera can do has grown. Otrera need not be simply a software version of MY engine; Otrera can be the software version of ANYONE's engine. The code is simple enough that even amateur coders can contribute.

With a little TLC, Otrera can be the software version of [thegamecrafter.com](http://thegamecrafter.com). Whereas they help game makers create the physical tools for their RPG's, Otrera will allow anyone to build an original game system from scratch.

This is the goal of the open source software project 'Otrera.' I intend to set up some kind of paid service for non-developers as well. That will be on a separate site and will include a web-based GUI for crafting original systems and games, as well as analytical tools and hosting. Users can make their own game from scratch, test it thoroughly for brokenness, and then host, patent, and sell their creations -- for a small fee.

There are a number of little utilities, scripts, and tools out there already, but no solid one stop shop for ambitious tabletop game creators. My dream is that someday, the following conversation will occur:

Dude 1: I have this awesome idea for a game actually but I don't know where to start

Dude 2: Dude, just use Otrera. It's stupidly easy.

Dude 1: I don't want to just copy someone else's system though, man.

Dude 2: No, dude, that's just it, it lets you make your own system from scratch.

Dude 1: Whoa, really? Cool.
