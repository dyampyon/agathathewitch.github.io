Things are going pretty well over the last week.

I've pushed some commits. I've gotten some help from my recruiting efforts. All in all, I'd say Otrera is still on track to be Kickstarter ready by the end of the month.

There are some legal issues I have to settle in anticipation of actually getting funding. I am considering setting up an LLC. Also need to decide on an open source license. I am getting some advice on these issues now.

Probably the biggest bit of progress concerns Engine Builder. After some reflection and discussion, I have decided on a way forward for how to actually code it. It requires three levels of abstraction and some smart JSON parsing, but it is well-within my capacity to do alone if needed. I am enjoying the sense of their being a light at the end of the tunnel.

The github and project site now have an API doc that better explains the data model. I am going to make Otrera play nice with other libraries by having clear contracts about what it outputs and why. Along with coding the Game Builder module, I hope to turn Otrera into a proper installable CLI tool this week.
