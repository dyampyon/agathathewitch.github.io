I have neglected this blog for two weeks. My apologies. I had good reasons.

There have been a number of changes in my life. For one, I changed jobs. I had been at my last startup for over four years. It was a tough decision to go, but ultimately I just felt stuck in rut; I found myself working on bugs from three years ago and got fed up.

My next gig allows me to work from home full-time. I am ecstatic about this. Less commuting and more sleeping in the mornings for one. Also more time to work on Otrera. Even more interesting, I am no longer tied to any particular location. I can leave the United States and go abroad indefinitely if I wish. I will probably start traveling next year.

There are some other big personal changes in my family. I shall not discuss them here, but suffice to say, it has been a transformative couple of weeks.

As far as Otrera is concerned, there have been a number of productive developments. I finally merged the 'structure' branch to master, meaning the code now uses the API doc data model and actually works. What's more I have volunteers helping me with the marketing site and social media accounts.

Otrera Technology is also a registered LLC with the state of New York. We have a logo, a patent, and business cards. The infrastructure is ready for Kickstarter - we just need a good demo and mockup.

I am also going to be attending the NYC Comic Con as an exhibitor. By then the Kickstarter will be in full-swing and I can use the opportunity to drive mailing list signups and generate some buzz. I am even hiring a cosplay model to promote Otrera during the convention. Interviews are this week.

It's hard to imagine that just a month ago, none of this was real. It was just some Python scripts that I thought might help me make a table top game. Now there is a real company with workers and finances. It's kind of overwhelming. I keep telling myself that I'm in over my head. That I am bound to fail and that no one will ever buy this product or that I will never finish it.

Maybe. But so what? Most new ideas / businesses fail. If we only tried things that were guaranteed to succeed, we would rarely try anything. Besides, it isn't like I have bet my livelihood on it. I've committed a few thousand dollars of my own money. In the worst case scenario, I'm out a nice vacation or two.

I do believe there is a market for Otrera though. It may be niche, but it's there, and if I can help that small community of homebrew developers, I will be satisfied.
