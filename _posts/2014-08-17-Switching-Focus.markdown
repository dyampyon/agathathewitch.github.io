Otrera Game Builder was completed on schedule. We now have a decent command line tool that allows for creating and editing games based on the default engine.

That's the good news. The bad news is that I think I may have to postpone the Kickstarter. There are two reasons for this. For one, I am still undecided about the type of demo / mockup I want to host for potential donors. I know I want to do some sort of Flask app, but I am not sure I can code something decent in the next two weeks. Secondly, I feel like it might be a good idea to spend more time getting to understand the community and market.

I've been posting on /r/rpg and board game / rpg geeks for a little while and I just feel out of step with the lingo and culture. I want to chat with people more there. See what their struggles are. Understand their process. I think that will help when I need to write anything that speaks directly to them.

Along with Flask and Engine Builder, encoding Pathfinder has become another major priority for me. I think that is an important proof of concept. The key is capturing the main character engine; I don't need to encode all of the content now, just an engine file that can properly generate Pathfinder content. I'll probably add the beginner box content, at least to start.
